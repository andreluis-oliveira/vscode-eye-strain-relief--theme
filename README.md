# What is High-Contrast Mode?

High-contrast mode is designed for users with weak eyesight to help them read text efficiently. The contrast of the screen is the ratio of the white color to the black. Setting the right contrast ratio is crucial for relaxing the eyes. Human eyes distinguish the best if white appears on a black background and vice versa. Hence, the contrast ratio should be higher for the eyes to lessen the stress on the eyes.
